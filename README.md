## Surface
### Design choices

The overall design of the website was to keep the site as clean and simple as possible, to allow the imagery of the food to shine through, and to choose colours that didn’t distract the user or take focus away from main purpose.

The site is straightforward to navigate, with a high contrasting navigation bar to enable ease of use for the user to find other main pages.

The background is neutral but bright, the images are not the focal point of the home page so the user has an immediate feeling to search for the of the menu to see the food.

Images choosen with done so with objective of enticing the user and naming scheme's for food items with designed to be playful and trigger the user to want to know more.

### Colours

The colour palette is:

 - #C8E6AC
 - #000000
 - text-white

After choosing a colour scheme I tested a number of palette options to make sure the it met accessibility standards. Idea was to keep it clean & simple with focus on readability.
